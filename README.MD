### Implementing Logic Throughout the Spring Boot Project
**Services -> Repositories -> Controllers**

1. **Controllers (Presentation Layer)**
   - **Purpose:** Handle HTTP requests and return responses.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Receive input from users via endpoints (e.g., REST APIs).
     - Validate input (optional if delegated to services).
     - Call the service layer to execute business logic.

2. **Services (Business Logic Layer)**
   - **Purpose:** Encapsulate business logic and coordinate between controllers and repositories.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Implement core business logic.
     - Handle validations and error handling.
     - Interact with one or more repositories.

3. **Repositories (Data Access Layer)**
   - **Purpose:** Communicate with the database.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Define methods for data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletions.
     - Leverage Spring Data JPA or any ORM framework.

4. **Entities (Data Model)**
   - **Purpose:** Represent database tables as Java objects.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Define fields and relationships.
     - Annotate with JPA annotations to map to database tables.

- Create a service to send emails (`EmailService.java`) with a `sendEmail` method.

### Adding Schedulers Using `@Scheduled`
- Create a scheduler class (`Scheduler`).
- Add `@EnableScheduling` annotation in the main class.
- Add `@Scheduled` annotation to methods to run them at specific times using CRON expressions.

### Connecting with Redis
- Install Redis.
- Add Redis dependency in `pom.xml`.
- Add Redis configuration in `application.yml` and `RedisConfig.java` to connect with the Redis server using `RedisTemplate`.
- Create a service (`RedisService.java`) to save and retrieve data from Redis with `get` and `set` methods.
- Create a controller (`RedisController.java`) to interact with Redis.

### Connecting with Redis Cloud
- Create an account in Redis Cloud.
- Create a Redis Cloud instance.
- Add Redis Cloud configuration in `application.yml` and `RedisCloudConfig.java` to connect with the Redis Cloud server.
- Use similar service and controller to interact with Redis Cloud.

## Learning Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event-streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events per day. It provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable systems to manage data streams in real-time.

---

### Key Concepts

### Kafka Cluster
A **Kafka Cluster** is a collection of Kafka brokers that work together to provide a distributed system for managing data streams.

### Kafka Broker
A **Kafka Broker** is a Kafka server that stores data and serves client requests (producers and consumers).

### Kafka Topic
A **Kafka Topic** is a category or feed name to which records are sent by producers. Topics organize the data streams.

- **Partitions**: A topic is divided into multiple partitions to allow data parallelism.
- **Offset**: Each record in a partition has a unique ID called the offset, which helps in identifying and accessing records.

### Kafka Producer
A **Kafka Producer** is a client application responsible for sending records to a Kafka topic.

- **Partitioner**: A class in the producer that determines which partition a record should be sent to.

### Kafka Consumer
A **Kafka Consumer** is a client application responsible for reading records from a Kafka topic.

### Kafka Streams
**Kafka Streams** is a client library for building real-time, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications and microservices. It enables stream processing directly within a Kafka ecosystem.

### Kafka Connect
**Kafka Connect** is a declarative integration framework designed to stream data between Kafka and other systems.

- **No Code Integration**: Kafka Connect allows you to configure source and destination systems without writing custom code. Data is directly fetched from the source and written to the destination.

### Why Didn't Integrate Cloud Kafka?
Cuz it's paid and I'm broke. ðŸ˜…

### Running Kafka Locally

1. **Download Kafka**: Download the Kafka binaries from the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
2. **Extract Kafka**: Extract the downloaded Kafka binaries to a folder.
3. **Start Zookeeper**: Go the windows folder in the Kafka directory and run the following command to start Zookeeper:
   ```bash
   .\zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties
   ```
4. **Start Kafka Server**: Go the windows folder in the Kafka directory and run the following command to start the Kafka server:
   ```bash
    .\kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties
    ```
5. **Create a Topic**: Run the following command to create a Kafka topic:
    ```bash
    .\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3
    ```
6. **Produce Messages**: Run the following command to start a Kafka producer:
    ```bash
    .\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-topic
    ```
7. **Consume Messages**: Run the following command to start a Kafka consumer:
    ```bash
    .\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my-topic --from-beginning
    ```

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
JWT contains three parts:
- **Header**: Contains the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm.
- **Payload**: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
- **Signature**: Used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

JWT is used to authenticate users and authorize access to resources.

### Integrating Swagger in Spring Boot
Swagger is a tool that helps in documenting and testing RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the APIs and understand their functionality.

Steps to integrate Swagger in a Spring Boot application:
1. **Install Swagger dependencies** in `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
       <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
       <version>1.6.14</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
2. **Add Swagger configuration** in `SwaggerConfig.java`:
   ```java
   package net.engineeringdigest.journalApp.config;

   import io.swagger.v3.oas.models.OpenAPI;
   import io.swagger.v3.oas.models.info.Info;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

   @Configuration
   public class SwaggerConfig {

       @Bean
       public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
           return new OpenAPI().info(
               new Info().title("Journal App API")
                         .description("By Ash")
           );
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Annotate controllers** with Swagger annotations to provide additional information about the APIs.
4. **Access the Swagger UI** at `http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/` or `http://localhost:8080/api/docs` (the configured path).
